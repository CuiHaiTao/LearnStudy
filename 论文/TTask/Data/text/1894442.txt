Its secretary general, Yeung Cho-ming, told the South China Morning Post that the museum was “definitely a political problem.”“The [June 4 incident] is sensitive and contentious. We are afraid the museum will bring us trouble. Someone might protest here and affect our daily operations,” he was quoted as saying.The group behind the museum said the legal threat was being orchestrated by those with loyalties to China.“This is obviously a politically motivated lawsuit,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, a local lawmaker and head of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group that organizes the June 4 candlelight vigil each year.The alliance bought the fifth floor of the office tower for $1.25 million last December, with a mission to preserve the memory of June 4 and to seek redress and accountability from Beijing's Communist Party leaders for those killed.Beijing maintains the democracy movement was a “counter-revolutionary event,” a denunciation protesters want overturned.Lee said the owners of two businesses in the building, Man Lee Electrical Co. and Reer Garment Manufactory Ltd, had told the owners' committee they would pay the legal fees for the lawsuit out of their own pocket. Neither company was willing to comment when Reuters visited their offices in the building.“I don't think any sensible person would use his own money to start a lawsuit, so there must be someone behind. Of course they would not divulge who is behind them,” Lee added.Mak Hoi Wah, a vice-chairman of the alliance, said 54 of 60 votes cast during last week's owners' committee meeting backed the legal challenge against the museum.The current president of the Chiu Chau Plastic Manufacturers Association, Lam Chun-hong, is a member of China's top political consultative body, the CPPCC, in southwestern Yunnan province, according to a membership list published by the Xinhua state news agency.Its honorary life president is Hong Kong billionaire and Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, according to its website There was no immediate comment from Li on whether he backed the legal challenge when contacted through his firm, Hutchison Whampoa.Earlier this year, Li warned that a planned “Occupy Central” protest to shut down the central business district to press for full democracy would damage the financial hubDespite fears the narrow building might be overrun with visitors, some tenants didn't see a problem.“I don't mind,” said Tong Chun-sing, who works for a design firm. “It won't affect our business.”
