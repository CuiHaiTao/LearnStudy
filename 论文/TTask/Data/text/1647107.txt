He said even though the government has been faster in providing relief and more transparent in giving out information to the public, compared to 2008, some technical issues remain.Tian said that near Longmen mountain, where the quake hit, there are some roads that are wide enough for trucks carrying weight to pass, but some areas where that is not advised.“In some parts there is only a narrow canyon, and that is where traffic jams occurred very early on [in the emergency response], there was no way to get information and rescue staff in,” Tian said.He said similar problems had occurred in 2008, and sending more helicopters to isolated areas earlier might have helped.In the early hours after the quake, hundreds of volunteers rushed to the region, in what Tian called a “warm, but perhaps too fast” response to the tragedy.Authorities are now telling volunteers not to enter the area, and to help keep local transportation and relief work unobstructed.“From 2008 Wenchuan earthquake we had already learned that in the first phase of rescue work, civil society organizations are not very effective,” Tian said. He adds that local NGOs will play a more important role later, when their expertise on local conditions will be crucial to help victims and rebuild the area.People have been making donations to charity organizations working for earthquake relief, and called for more online transparency over the funds' allocation.Many Chinese have preferred to give their money to smaller, private NGOs instead of larger state-run groups, like the Red Cross which in recent years had been tainted by some corruption scandals.On Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, many posted survival tips and advice on how to help others in an earthquake.Chinese University of Hong Kong's Chan said more government action is needed to help educate the public about quake survival and response.Although the government has stressed the need to help oneself until other help arrives, many living in remote areas are the elderly and the young who, analysts said, are less equipped to face emergency and find shelter.
